                        <td>Yes, building websites is exciting. I've learned some programming languages, such as C, C++, java etc. And this semester, I'm learning iOS programming and started to learn about swift. Learning a new language is always interesting and challenging. I knew a little about web programming, html and javascript but not much. I'm willing to gain more knowledge about web programming and designing skills in this course.</td>

                        <td>Both, I guess. Usually, I'm doing the front-end work, so it's not merely coding stuff, but also UI designing, and interface designing. Design itself is attractive, and seeing work come out of my own idea is even more encouraging.</td>

                        <td>I can be a front-end designer and a warm-hearted team organizer. I guess I'm going to solo in this course. Trying to finish all the task by myself and build a website on one's own is excting.</td>
